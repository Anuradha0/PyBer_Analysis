# PyBer_Analysis

Overview:
The project we have been assigned it to create a summary of the PyBer data by the city types of Urban, Suburban, and Rural and to show the metrics for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fair per ride and average fare per driver. 
Once we have created the metrics, we then need to create a multi-line graph to display the weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we will summarize the results and present our recommendations

Results:

1) Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares followed by Suburban than Rural
2) Rural cities being the least amount of drivers,rides & fares the have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver and vice versa for Urban cities

1) All three city types start to rise to a peak at the end for February. For the Urban city type, that oscillating peak lasts through April, while the other city types wane in the month of March.

2) The Rural city type increases again leading into the month of April. The Suburban city type starts to peak again at the end of April, while the Rural city type drops off.

Summary:

From our data we are able to tell what kind of fares will be commanded based on what city type the passenger is catching a ride in. Although we didn't explore every individual city we still have a great grasp on what fares will look like from week to week based on city type which is enough information decide on rates that will need to be charged after we can classify what type of city the consumer lives in. In conclusion we can effectively say that a rural area will command a higher fare because there are fewer workers that will come to this area, the travel time and distance is most likely longer making the average fare per ride & driver the most out of all city types.

Recommendations:
1) As per the graph, I can observe that during the mid of February to March all cities has a spike of fare, means increase in rides. So during that period company can raise the ride rates per mile
2) Similarly during the dip, company can offer discounts to lure the customers
3) Rural and suburban has more drivers than total rides which means there is possibility that all customers are not getting cab service due to unavailability of drivers
4) Urban cities has more drivers than the total no. of rides, which means it has many drivers are not in use. Company can relocate them to their best interest rural area
